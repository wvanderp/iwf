# Future development of IWF

## Things that could need some improvement

- [ ] the way we work with the Wikidata api is kinda messy, we should make it more consistent

## Things that could be added

- [ ] most of the input validation missing and assumes that the developer knows what they are doing. We could use some trust but verify.
